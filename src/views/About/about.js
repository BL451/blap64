            I am a Toronto-based multidisciplinary artist, creative technologist, and educator who creates interactive installations, audio-reactive performance visuals, and algorithmic plotter drawings. As an educator, I lead workshops and mentorship programs focused on both the technical aspects of new media arts and the application of open source software for social impact.<br /><br />
            Much of my artistic process is centered around architecting and programming generative and perceptive systems to create and interpret visuals and sound. My work has been showcased at group and solo exhibitions as well as live performances at InterAccess Gallery, Northern Contemporary Gallery, Long Winter Music & Arts Festival, UKAI Projects, and on the p5.js website. Building on these experiences, the current focus of my artistic research is on the usage of playful and novel interaction mechanisms such as computer vision, audio analysis, and AI to enable new ways of learning, interpreting, and connecting with the world around us.
