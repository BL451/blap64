            This is a website built by a human using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
            p5.js<br /><br />
            I belive it's highly valuable to understand how to do things from
            the ground up, especially with the plethora of frameworks that are
            overkill for many projects and websites.<br /><br />
            Long live the handmade web.
