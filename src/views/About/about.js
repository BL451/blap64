                This is a website built by a human using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                and p5.js<br /><br />
                I belive it's highly valuable to understand how to do things
                from the ground up, especially with the plethora of frameworks
                that are overkill for many projects and websites.<br /><br />
                Long live the handmade web.
            </p>
        </div>
    </body>
