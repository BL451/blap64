Also exhibited on March 29th, 2025 at the UKAI Projects \"Farewell to the Bridge\" 24 hour art festival (Toronto, Canada).\n\nThis installation was built using the original Leap Motion hand-tracking controller for enabling interactivity, JavaScript with the p5.js creative coding library for realtime visuals, and Chataigne for the convenient mapping and routing of hand-tracking information between the two.",

        description: "We Play In The World They Make is an interactive role-playing game installation where five participants compete for resources while consulting AI companions that embody different ideological positions. Each player is paired with a distinct AI shrine representing power structures—DOGMA, ATTENTION, ACCUMULATION, PRIVILEGE, and POWER—that offer strategic advice aligned with their respective worldviews. An AI judge evaluates player pitches based on algorithmic criteria including movement stability, vocal clarity, and conformity. The work examines how algorithmic systems embed particular visions of the future while positioning participants as both collaborators with and subjects of machine intelligence.\n\nMultiple runs of the game prototype were played on March 29th, 2025 at the UKAI Projects \"Farewell to the Bridge\" 24 hour art festival (Toronto, Canada).\n\nThis installation incorporates multiple AI systems: the JUDGE uses computer vision and speech recognition to evaluate player performances, while AI companions like ACCUMULATION employ OCR to interpret handwritten communications, creating a complex ecosystem of human-AI interaction within structured competitive play.",

Drawing on Derrida's concept of \"hauntology,\" the work critiques pervasive surveillance systems by making visible our complicity within technological infrastructures that shape reality while remaining largely invisible.\n\nCreated as part of the Aberrant AI residency hosted by UKAI Projects. First prototype exhibited at The Bridge Open Studio event (Toronto, Canada) on January 17th, 2025.\n\nCollaboration with software artist Ryan Kelln under the ArtRemains Collective. This installation was built using computer vision and AI technologies for gaze detection, with custom software for real-time video processing and interactive response.",
